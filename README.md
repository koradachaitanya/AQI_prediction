# AQI_prediction
Developed a full-stack ML web app to predict AQI using PM2.5, NO₂, O₃, and CO. Built a Scikit-learn model with StandardScaler and deployed it via a Flask REST API backend. Created an interactive frontend with real-time predictions, AQI visualization, and health recommendations. Configured Flask, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Gunicorn for deployment.
